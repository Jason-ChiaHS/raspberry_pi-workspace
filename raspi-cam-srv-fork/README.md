# Fork of raspi-cam-srv for [Raspberry-Pi-IMX500-SDK](https://pentas-gitlab.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com/pentas-member/raspberry-pi-imx500-sdk)

This Fork is to allow the integration of the project with the existing [Raspberry-Pi-IMX500-SDK](https://pentas-gitlab.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com/pentas-member/raspberry-pi-imx500-sdk). This integration is to be able to do 2 things:
1. Test and Generate camera configs
   1. This is so they can be used when running the actual demo
2. Allow for data collection
   1. Since the project has the ability to capture video as well as pictures
